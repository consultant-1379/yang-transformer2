	description 
		"The module extends and deviates tailf-acm.
		
		Defaults are set to deny. In general it is cleaner to build groups of 
	 	permissions than denials or a mix of them. Contradicting denials in different groups
	 	could harm the additive concept of role-based-access-control and the 
	 	ordering of groups (at external user management) will start to matter 
	 	as order of rules is respected.
	 	
	 	NOTE: THIS MODULE BLOCKS ACCESS TO ALL CLI COMMANDS BY DEFAULT. 
	 	THE SERVER SHOULD BE LOADED WITH INITIAL DATA ALLOWING AT LEAST ADMIN ACCESS TO THE CLI.
